# Ottis-side-quest
a game ("engine")

It's too early for me to give exact instructions on how to use this. As soon as I have something more solid, I will work on the documentation. Any suggestions are welcome :)

I don't know how to code in c++, I'm trying my best though.
Might switch from SFML to Vulkan or openGL idk.
